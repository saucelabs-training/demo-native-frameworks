# Define a list of devices on which the tests should be executed.
devices:

    # Provide a list of test cases or test classes. If you want to run all tests of a class, provide the class name by itself.
    #  To run a specific class method, provide both the class and method names.
    #  You may specify multiple testClass parameters. As described above, each testClass will execute serially on the device indicated.
