# Define a list of devices on which the tests should be executed.
devices:

  # Example 5: Parallel execution using dynamic devices
  # Run two tests on separate specific devices in my pool, this can be US/EU
  # Use `deviceNameQuery` to find any free iPhone 11
  # or iPhone X and run the test on it.
  - datacenter: EU

    # Provide a list of test cases or test classes. If you want to run all tests of a class, provide the class name by itself.
    #  To run a specific class method, provide both the class and method names.
    #  You may specify multiple testClass parameters. As described above, each testClass will execute serially on the device indicated.
    #  Each testClass must be preceded by a hyphen (e.g. '- testClass'), whereas testMethod parameters must be at the same indentation
    #  level as testClass, without the hyphen
